Write a react component that will display the current value of our counter.

The counter should start at 0.
There should be a button to add 1.
There should also be a button to subtract 1.

We want to be able to see the value of the counter - so it should be rendered!

In your render:

The counter display element should have the id 'counter'
Your increment button should have the id 'increment'
Your decrement button should have the id 'decrement'

In this kata you'll learn how to control Components with different kinds of beasts.
Your goal is to tame and control a beast by building a controlled React component with the following criteria:
- Create a component called `Beast` and its state `name`
- The beast to control can be passed as a prop `name`
- Render a textinput field with the id `controlledName`. Its value should be the name of the current beast.
- Whenever this field's value is modified, the state should be updated as well
- You should control the beast `Yeti` by default

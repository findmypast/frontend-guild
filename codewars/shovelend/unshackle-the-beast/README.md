In this kata you'll learn how to use uncontrolled components in ReactJS with different kinds of chained beasts.
Your goal is to release a beast by building an uncontrolled React component with the following criteria:
- Create a component called `BeastForm`.
- The beast to release can be passed into an input element with the id `beastToRelease` living in a form element with the id `beastForm`.
- The form needs to be submitted with a submit button and call a function to handle the form submission.
- This function needs to call an already existing function `unshackle` with the beast to release. 
- This function also needs to call `preventDefault` on the passed parameter.

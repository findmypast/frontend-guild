# Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a place where you can train on code
katas. You solve small problems that range in difficulty from very easy to very
difficult. The idea is to repeatedly practice on toy problems and analyse
solutions to hone your coding skills.

Once you create an account, please join the `Findmypast` clan to join your
fellow coworkers.

Here is some information about [how to create a kata](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Create-Your-First-Kata) from Codewars.

We can also create and share katas. We can keep track of FMP codewars katas by
placing them under this directory. For example

```
codewars/
├── README.md
├── dideler
│   └── some-kata
│       ├── index.js
│       ├── index.spec.js
│       └── README.md
└── rkotze
    └── another-kata
        ├── index.js
        ├── index.spec.js
        └── README.md
```

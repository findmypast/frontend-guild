# United State

Some say The United States has never been so divided. This Kata is a chance for you to unite
a once great nation and MAKE AMERICA CODE AGAIN!

## What's Involved

- State
- Changing State
- Conditional Rendering based on state

## The challenge

You will be given a component called `States`. You will need to establish an initial state for
the component called `united` and for it to be set to __false__.

Then write a `unite` function that changes this state to __true__.

Then conditionally render a bespoke message in the component.

If the States are united then display "Code for everyone"

If the States aren't united then display "Make America code again"
